# Coral Size-Dependent Fates

This repository contains an example R script that demonstrates how to analyse **size-dependent fates** in *Acropora digitifera* coral colonies, a subsection of my research published in **Lachs et al., (2025) Rising cover amid population density decline: the unstable demography of a reef-building coral** (https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.250271). The paper looks into the demography and population dynamics of a coral species in Palau.

It is based on real project workflows but uses **demo data** (`Size_fates_demo.xlsx`) for reproducibility.

## Features
- Data cleaning and binning of coral colony size classes
- Stacked bar plots of fate proportions by size bin and site
- Radius vs. area quality-control plots
- Logistic regression models of survival and growth probability
- Combined plots showing size-dependent demographic patterns
